# Usage
`dotnet psbg.dll`  

Example config.json and templates included in `examples`. Put these files/folders in same directory as `psbg.dll`.  
Proper documentation will be put together eventually, but for now just read these examples and piece it together.

# Current Pitfalls
psbg *will* just error out and crash if you improperly make a template. Follow the examples.

# Building
run `dotnet restore`, then `dotnet build` :thumbsup:
